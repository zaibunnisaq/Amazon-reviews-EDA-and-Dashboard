Very bright, colorful animation that makes everything look very nice.  A wide variety of creative characters each with their own special personality and goofy problems.  Solid storytelling that makes the characters more interesting, and a very wild adult sense of humor that has *so* much creativity you can barely keep up with the constant jumping around.  Imagine a more violent Simpsons or Futurama with the pacing in hyper mode.  That's basically what Drawn Together is all about.",

    "text":"People who like cartoons must be thankful for DVDs, because that technology opened up the floodgates for fans for every kind of animation. Whether you like classic Looney Tunes, hippy-dippy sci-fi parables or Asian tentacle porn, it's all there for you to find and enjoy. It's only been in the last 20 years or so, however, that American TV networks have clued into the idea that many adults like cartoons that have content specifically aimed at adults, even though some cartoons did well in prime-time even fifty years ago or so. Now, with DVD, you can not only watch entire seasons at a shot, you can also see the shows in their unadulterated glory.Which brings us to the Comedy Central series Drawn Together. I've been a fan of this show for a while, partly because of the writing and partly because of the cheerful way in which it steamrolls political correctness and good taste. If South Park is the Mount Everest of crude, crass animation, then Drawn Together is K2; it doesn't stand as tall, but it's a tougher climb. The truth of this was brought home upon watching the second season of the show on DVD. Much to my surprise, watching the DVD turned out to be a different experience than watching it in first run.Part of this is due to one of the DVD set's selling points: it's unexpurgated. I didn't think this would make much of a difference, as it's generally pretty clear what's been cut. As it turns out, there was a lot cut out of the show, and not just language: genitalia, violence, enough racist abuse to make the KKK turn red under their sheets, sex in a vast array of configurations and a whole lot of other content that probably produces instant pucker in the unfortunate souls who work in Comedy Central's Standards and Practices department. Now, I'm not one for censorship, but the additional material works against the show to a certain degree. What's there is still funny in multiple senses, from satire to slapstick, but actually being able to hit the money words (and shots) dilutes the humor a bit.As far as taste goes, DT is not a show to start novices on. If adult animation is still a new concept for you, and you think The Simpsons is bleeding-edge in the sometimes fluid space between being socially acceptable and being a pariah, then DT may cause seizures. For people who like edgy animation, this will be just the ticket. The voiceover artists and writers take their material seriously, and they're willing to go wherever the jokes take them (the season finale has a running gag with historical dates and the episodes connected to them that manages to be both subtle and sick).In terms of presentation, the DT set is relatively bare-bones. The whole season of 15 episodes is crammed onto two discs, leaving just enough room for a handful of interviews with the voiceover artists (minus Adam Carolla, who has plenty to do outside the show) and a karaoke singalong. The visual quality is pretty sharp, and the sound quality is good, but this isn't the kind of material you use to do any THX certifications with, so it's not like you'd expect much. Still, it's the episodes that matter, and for you sick little monkeys out there who like this kind of thing, Drawn Together season 2 is a worthwhile expenditure.

Those who aren't into extremely crude humor won't be as entertained, though.This season picks up with the previous's cliffhanger of the plane crash, then quickly tries to top the previous season. It pokes fun at the shows & characters that it's based on as well as making jabs at it's critics. The DVD set is uncensored, which is nice but some of the jokes lose a bit of their punch. Half of the fun of watching it on TV is that things are blurred & curse words are bleeped. Even so, fans of this series will be glad to own this set. Anyone else? Better off renting it.",

    "text":"The second season of Comedy Central's animated, reality TV spoofing Drawn Together gets off to a great start, but sadly, it wears thin the further it goes on.  The season begins where the first one left off, with the house mates crash landing and eventually getting back to the house for plenty of animated insanity.  The visual gags are still quite funny, but the show's constant bombardment of homophobic jokes (especially with Captain Hero, which gets real boring and tired) and toilet humor without any kind of substance goes from hysterical to boring and contrived.  Granted we see the same kind of treatment on South Park, but with that show there's always an underlining hint of social commentary at the very least.  You won't find much of that here with Drawn Together, but then again, the show never really attempts to do such a thing either.  All that being said, there's still plenty to admire with the second season of Drawn Together, but it's nowhere near as funny as the first season was either.  All in all though, if you enjoy the show for what it's worth despite it's flaws, this DVD set is definitely worth picking up regardless.",

For the rest... Anything's game (which means laughing material) for this show. They'll stop at nothing on the road to destroying all taboos! And that's how this satiric animated show found itself a place in a rather crowded category (by quality even more than by quantity), where The Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy reign. But DT pushes the limit even further, nesting in that dirty area where even the other three won't go.The only limit to that strategy is that DT is burning the candle by the two ends, and hadn't the show been cancelled at the end of the third season, they'd probably have run out of taboos to break, anyway, after 4 to 5 years.But let's salute the effort and appreciate the freedom of speech of the show, even if half of this liberty's wasted on filthy, disgusting, low-level jokes.

    "text":"I can't say enough great things about this wonderful tv-series! It makes the Bible and biblical events come to life. While I don't know how many of the \"mysteries\" are \"mysteries\" because to me as a Methodist Christian it appears that God has clearly stated what He means in the Bible by most of these \"mysteries,\" but other topics that are explored that God seems to be silent about in the Bible are fascinating to learn about via the professors and archaelogists that are in this dynamic series on the Bible. Do I agree with everything the scholars say about the Bible and some of the mysteries that are explored in this great series? Definitely no! However, if you love the Bible as much as I do as well as have an interest in knowledge; especially, biblical questions and mysteries, then this series is definitely worth buying! I haven't bought this dvd collection, yet, but I have rented the dvds and seen the tv series when it used to air on tv and it's a great DVD collection to add to your already pre-existing dvd collection! The price is affordable and well worth it! For the knowledge alone, I'm surprised that it doesn't cost well over $100 for this entire series! A & E should create new episodes of \"Mysteries of the Bible\" because no other documentary series about the Bible seems to be as good as this one.",

    "text":"I want to limit my comments to a review of Vol. 3 - King David: Poet Warrior. Since the middle of the 19th century skeptics have attacked the historical veracity of the Bible (both the Hebrew & Christian Scriptures). Since that time one new-found archaeological discovery after another has negated each of these objections (from the existence of the Hittites to King David to the use of nails in Roman crucifixion to affix people to crosses). Not content with the biblical accounts of these now historical figures this video series seeks to deconstruct them by projecting on them present-day academic political and philosophical \"theories behind the legendary figures and fabled stories of the Bible.\" If this one part of series utilizes this approach it is likely it is shared with the rest of the series. \"Twenty-two full-length programs from the acclaimed A&E series MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE are featured in this collection providing a wealth of astonishing discoveries and unforgettable revelations.\" Unfortunately, the only \"unforgettable\" aspect of this series is that it is long on theory and short on facts.",

The set is getting dated - going back to the mid-90's, but not much has changed dramatically in the field of Biblical Archeology - which is largely the premise.  The narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons is pretty good, though cal lull you to sleep with the dulet tones.  The content is good as well, with interview of scholars, archaeologists, religious, and others who interweave the various components together to explore some of the Bible's unanswered and unanswerable questions. The integration of Jewish and Christian thought is well done, and I believe that either Christian or Jew will find this set entertaining and enlightening.  If you are a heavy duty Bible scholar, this is pretty light weight.  For the bulk of us, though, you will learn a lot, it will pique your interest, and you can feel comfortable that there isn't a great religious agenda behind the shows.",

Viewers of all faiths and denominations will find that it deepens and enriches their understanding and appreciation for the spiritual lessons of the Bible. Each episode is well-rounded, beautifully photographed and a complete delight to watch.The Mysteries of the Bible series weaves questions about the Biblical figures, culture and spiritual meaning into a visual and intellectual feast. It combines actual footage of locations in the Bible with amazing religious art, captivating narration and answers from archeology and a spectrum of Biblical scholars. It's a formula that mesmerized fans for years. Who would have thought that a show like this would so captivate the non-scholars among us?This series succeeded for so long because it recognized that readers of the world's most popular book want to know and understand more about the culture, context and deeper meanings of the Bible. You won't regret purchasing any of the episodes or DVD's. This series represents the best of the best.",

Get a few actual holy land documentaries.What's on the discs? Lessee:disc 1 - Jesus holy child. Execution of Jesusdisc 2 -Abraham: one man one god.

Okay, so the 22 episodes offered here are all interesting and informative. What I liked best about the series is that they are going on the premise that everything in the Bible is to be looked at as fact. However, the series does offer the opinions of scholars that sometimes suggest otherwise and they pose some interesting facts and questions that do not always line up with archeological finds. When asked for their opinions, scholars will offer beliefs that do not always line up with most dogmatic ways of thinking, In other words, I understood this series to be unbiased and presented the facts fairly and allowed different opinions to be heard. Many of them which surprisingly do support many held beliefs we have all been taught.When I first bought this series a few years ago, I watched it but really couldn't appreciate it. Now that I am actively involved in religious education, I see this series in a whole different light. It has the basic information for beginners, but also has many surprising facts that I still didn't know after many years of hard religious studies. I certainly recommend this set as a supplement to anyone's religious pursuits and it makes a great starting point for discussions as well. Well put together and well presented. Thanks for doing such a great job!",

You will find yourself rooting for the pair in every episode leading up to the finale.Innocent touches, shy glances, head tilts, and flirting, make Season 1 the best of the series.Oh yeah. There's the token bitchy cheerleader, Madison, to stir up some drama for the should-be\/might-be\/could-be couple. The adopted black brother to teach us about racial identity. An overbearing mother. A shirtless boy to keep the straight audience happy. And a father any teenage girl would be envious to have.But when all is said and done, this show is entirely about Spencer and Ashley.It is too good to be cancelled before it's time. Watch Season 3B on October 10th at 9pm and Save Spashley!",

There are changes in dialogue and content.  This is very upsetting given the price, but most important is amazon's not being completely forth coming in it's product description.

It really looks like it was just downloaded from one of the sites that it streams from. The picture is fuzzy and the audio is kind of flat. People who have reviewed the DVD version have had similar complaints.I wanted to get this show so that I could show it to someone else, but I'm not sure I'd buy any other seasons of it, instead I'll just watch it online.

I want to secure everybody that wants to buy it by saying that on dvd, blu-ray and on a computer, everything is working perfectly, I tried it. Moreover, some wanted to know if there were any extras in the dvds such has interviews, deleted scenes or bloopers and there is none (sorry), only the episodes. However, now, for the appreciation part of the serie, I would definetly recommend South of Nowhere to teenagers who like romantic\/drama series. Even though your not gay, you can fully appreciate this tv show for its originality, its funny parts and its themes such has love, teenage \"problems\" (first time, moving in a new city, fitting in, the need to belong somewere, ennemies, etc.). And for the girls that are gay, well, you will appreciate this story because of all the reasons above and because it shows, trough Spencer's story, all the steps that someone goes trough when they gradually find out their true sexuality and how they live their first real love. Furthermore, I have to say this, Ashley (Mandy Musgrave)and Spencer (Gabrielle Christian)are really gorgeous and they form a beautiful couple. S.O.N. is amazing!",

    "text":"I was very pleased with my recent purchase of season one of south of nowhere on DVD. I had read some bad things about this set but I bought it anyway, I was a big fan of the show back then and I just wanted to be able to watch it again. I wanted to buy all 3 seasons but that would have been pretty expensive. lol I do plan to buy the other two later. But as some have already stated, the theme music is different. I didn't like it at first but after you watch it all the way through you don't mind the theme music, it's just strange to me that they changed it...? this is a great gift for anyone you may know struggling with their sexuality. it got me through some tough times with my own when it was on television and now I can sit back and watch Spencer's plight knowing what she's gone through already firsthand. The set is only 3 DVDs long it's a very short season, that's why it's so cheap compared to season 2 & 3 but I recommend it to anyone. I really wish everyone would watch the whole season I think it would change some views of a lot of closed-minded people. All three seasons of the show depict a young girl struggling to balance between making her mother, a religious woman with strong opinions, happy and letting herself be who she is finding out she is. Her father, a guidance counselor of sorts, just wants her to be happy but he's got his own problems. The story also centers on her two brothers, one adopted and looking for his birth mother, and one blood brother who is trying to be a basketball star and runs into complications along the way. Ashley and Spencer are adorable together and this is, above all, a love story for the next generation. The set itself is no fuss no muss, comes with just the box and 3 DVDs, conservatively decorated, but it's what is inside that counts, which is hours of enjoyment that will make you go \"awww!\" and have you smiling to yourself. I would give this whole series as a gift to anyone and everyone if it weren't so expensive I think everyone should watch it it's both entertaining and helpful in understanding the plight of lesbian and bisexual people. Ashley never says she's a lesbian (that I remember. at least not in this season) and sometimes she plays around with aiden but in the end we know she's not into men. Spencer is \"not into labels\" and I love her for that so we never know whether to classify either of them as \"bi\" or \"gay\" as spencer called it, but I can pretty safely say  this is a show about girls, for girls, of any orientation. It's compelling and full of sweet moments anyone could enjoy.",

Paula has a hard time accepting Ashley for being a lesbian and Spencer's best friend. The Carlins are a catholic family who moves from Ohio to Los Angeles CA. Although it's a teen show that shows sexuality differences there are other characters as well as their relationships. A definite recommend.",

The DVD picture quality is also quite good, and it is nice not to have network adverts crawling across the screen.However, I cannot give a good rating to a DVD set which hacks up the original show.  If you're really a fan, you will consider this to be a low-quality, defective release, and you may consider it inferior to off-air copies.The theme music has been completely replaced with a different song.  This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs.  The original song is, of course, much more appropriate and better.There may be other unidentified cuts and alterations, as the series used a lot of rather expensive music.The versions on Amazon Unbox and iTunes have the same cuts.The DVDs have several mastering errors; the \"choose episode\" option simply doesn't work.",

South of Nowhere got its hooks in me with the first episode and was surprised to find one of the executive producers is rose troche who was responsible for a lot if not most of the gay films i have in my collection from my own generation.  I love the show and i think its an important show for anyone gay or straight. It isn't just about spencer and ashley and the prejudice and relationship struggles they face but also what its like to be a black boy from Ohio thrown into the big scary city being raised by a white family and struggling with the fact that he was given up by his biological mother.  It shows a mothers bigotry and how it affects her relationship with her daughter.  It shows a family that is religious but at the same time is far from perfect.  Its a show about family, friends, new beginnings and old problems. i love it",

    "text":"I downloaded this with a gift certificate from the Creative Zen purchase.  I've seen pieces of Woody Mann's DVD on Blind Blake, and as an instructor, he appears to know how to communicate with someone who is trying to learn.  In other words, his demonstrations are slow (but still in rhythmic time), and his explanations are meticulous and succinct.However, Amazon's Unbox download is lacking a pdf tablature to supliment the video download.  This could be detramental to people who want to learn the styles Mann teaches (Lonnie Johnson, Memphis Minnie, etc...) but do not have the musical vocabulary, or have not yet been introduced to it.My suggestion to the buyer is if you get stuck, find some mp3s & online tabs of these artists works, learn their phrases and then come back to this video for Woody Mann to help explain the thinking \/ theory behind these individual styles.  Because I know if I had not already learned one or two songs from these artists, along with some basic fretboard theory, I wouldn't know where to begin with this $14 purchase.Or just don't buy this video.  Spend the few extra bucks on the physical dvd and booklet.  Whatever works for you.(Note to Amazon:  The three stars is based on Amazon's poor judgement to not include pdf tabs.  This idea of downloading instructional videos is fantastic, but can easily be undermined by poor execution on the provider's part.)",

Now they have added those episodes back in (and increased the price) so my major objection is over.On the merit of the series itself, this is quite a steal.  This has to be one of the all-time best Anime series, especially for those who like a darker, edgier anime.  This is pure young character drama here, at its best.  There are mecha in this series (well, one), but it plays an extremely minor role and mecha fans should not get this series on that alone (get it because it's awesome!).  I really can't recommend this story enough.If Amazon would let me change my star rating, I would. (originally rated at 1-star for missing episodes).  I would give it a 3 star (5 for story, but its only available on Unbox dubbed, no subtitled version).Let me restate that.  This is the dubbed version of the anime, not the subtitled version.

    "text":"While Road Fools 12 is an amazing video, I am disappointed that I was not warned prior to my purchasing this product that it was an \"e-movie\" or whatever it's called. I never would have bought it had I realized that it was not available in DVD format. I don't like the idea of sitting at the computer watching this entire video, and none of the devices I own are included in Amazon's list of compatible devices that will allow me to watch this on my TV. Furthermore, there is a \"no refund\" policy on these \"e-movies,\" so I am stuck with this $15 video that I have yet to, and probably never will, watch in its entirety. This is the first negative experience I have had with Amazon and I hope they will either change their refund policies or add a warning to these kinds of videos in the future.",

I've poured concrete professionally for 15 years and I thought it would be interesting to watch someone else's technique. I feel that a sidewalk could be a do-it-yourself type of job, IF you have the motivation. but if you plan on pouring a 16 x 22' drive way (especially in the summer) you MUST have someone helping you who knows about concrete. the air temperature, humidity, slump and wind all have a strong bearing on how the concrete will dry. Ready mix yards may suggest a retarder for adverse drying conditions but you really do need to know what you are doing. The timing of when to start finishing the concrete is never the same twice, so maybe the 10 min. limit he suggested is ok or maybe not. If you fresno the surface before it's ready and the bleed water can come up you will seal it and this can result in blistering, peeling and dusting of the surface which will greatly reduce the life of your concrete. I would suggest reading the ACI (ASCC1). You only get 1 shot to do it right and concrete is hard within 90 minutes of leaving the mix plant so be careful.",

The episodes for Season Five are all quite well written, with some interesting plot twists and red herrings for those who are trying to figure out \"who done it.\"  For American fans, it is interesting to see how the \"Amber Alert\" system is set up in Bradfield, the location for the series, in \"The Color of Amber\"; I did find the writing in this one episode to be at times a bit too convoluted with a few too many side stories going on.  Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.  My only complaint is that there are only a few episodes released each season (although they are nearly 90 minutes long a piece).  We want more Wire in the Blood!",

Perhaps if they had spent a little more on subtitling ?????  Even with earphones, I could not make out 90% of the dialogue.",

    "text":"This is not a review for season five only but also for all four previous seasons as well as season six currently being shown on British television.The show tells the story of a crime detective unit based in a fictional city in northern England. Together with the help of a brilliant but dysfunctional clinical psychologist (played to perfection by Robson Green), they try to solve the most grisly and disturbing murder cases.Each episode lasts 90 minutes so this gives more room for character and story development. It's also more brutal, intense and violent than most television shows so not for the squeamish.This is state of the art finely crafted crime drama featuring strong scripts and three dimensional characters you really care for. The acting by all involved is truly superb and the writing is top notch. It's riveting, captivating, engrossing, gripping and powerful stuff with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the last minute. This will have you glued on your sofa and make you shiver. Turn off the lights, sit comfortably and enjoy!",

As another reviewer stated, he has perfected the role, ([bleeding heart psychiatrist]), who seems less afraid, but rather enchanted, with the illnesses of his patients. He empathizes with how they got the way they are instead of despising them for how they evolved from their molding circumstances. Without condescention, he faces the bad (the killer), and the good (the police and innocent victims), without judging either. That could make him appear apathetic, or stoic, but doesn't because of the way he has a grip on the role he plays (compassionate!). I have all of the captioned above and hope the rumors aren't true that this is the last of WIRE....But if it is, I'll be looking forward to whatever he does next!",

The episodes are gripping, any case involving children are nerve wrecking and potentially heart breaking, the third episode has an unexpected end and the last one is frightening for it's possibilities, so all the episodes are very intense.

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.",

    "text":"I've been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one, but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time, and less \"demented\" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written, produced, and directed in an entirely different style, e.g., the first one is fast-paced, with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds, while the second one is very grainy, jumpy, and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color, giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring, but it works extremely well.Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol, but Alex is at least as compelling, if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula, as the \"minor\" characters, are superbly well written and well acted.And then there's Tony, who is my \"small exception.\" He's as charming and likeable as ever, if not more so, and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We don't really see just how much of a complete oddball he is. However, they more than made up for it in \"Prayer of the Bone\" so I can't really even call it a flaw.If you like a truly suspenseful, intelligent, multi-layered drama, but previous episodes have left you uncertain about watching this series, give season five a try.",

As with all of the series, though, all of the core characters gain some detail. The cinematography deserves some notice, as well, particularly as this DP, Dominic Clemence, avoids the hand-held excesses that crop up and intrude with some later DPs. The visual element, combination of scenic with close work, contribute a great deal to the specific story, but also add to a continued sense of mood and atmosphere. The care in production and editing doesn't jump into the foreground, as it shouldn't, but gives the action an excellent context. Ironically, one of the producers has commented repeatedly that they long to replicate the work of American crime drama, but this series is an excellent example of what the US could produce, but doesn't.",

    "title":"If Only We Could Make Out What They're Saying",
    "text":"\"Wire in the Blood, Season 5,\" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial, based on the works of Val McDermid, to reach these shores.  The series, a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill, criminal profiler, is produced by Green's production company for the British Granada TV: he's one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here, which has been spun off as a standalone.In addition to Green, the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries, and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding, Hill's foil, romantic and otherwise.  This season, as most, is simply advertised as \"based on characters created by\" McDermid, and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However, the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality, solid mysteries, with some of the well-known author's intensity; some of her edginess and grit, and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid, of course, is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home, you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent, lightened, a bit, by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot, which McDermid is, Scots-born.At any rate, the series is set in McDermid's fictional \"Bradfield,\" it is filmed in Manchester, the actual city in which she sets her work, after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchester's an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here, full of interesting looking architecture, with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately, the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect, and there are no subtitles, a puzzling oversight considering Green's standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.1. \"Colour of Amber.\"  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street, in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery, dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.2. \"Nocebo.\"  A sadistic, ritualistic killer seems to be at work, targeting children.  Another strong, intense episode, more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be, giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher, Dr.Kingston.3. \"Names of Angels.\" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive, blond young businesswomen.  A clever, perhaps too clever, outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character, clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  \"Christopher\" has been a patient of Hill's while imprisoned for the crime, and, as he was so young when he committed it, he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.4. \"Anything You Can Do.\" Yet another apparent serial killer at work, putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one, but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of \"Christopher,\" the released Liverpool child murderer.Green is, of course, a handsome man, and a good actor, and he gives us an intense, intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.  If only we could make out what he's saying.",

    "text":"Just so you know!!!Episode One: Prayer of the Bone, was considered a \"special\" and is not included in the Season 5 Set. It is scheduled to be released as a separate DVD on August 5th 2008. Each episode is about 83 minutes in length. This is a quality series that seems to improve each year as the character delvelopment matures.~ ~ SEASON 5 EPISODES ~ ~Episode One: Prayer of the BoneIn the season premiere, Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) finds himself a fish out of water when he's invited to Texas as an expert witness in a case where an Iraq combat veteran has confessed to brutally slaughtering his wife and two young children. His defense team claims that he's suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but the prosecution asks Tony, who met with the soldier in the UK, to join them in disproving that claim. Alone in a strange country, surrounded by hostile lawyers and police, Tony finds himself at the center of a death penalty case with competing legal and political interests. He's insulted, threatened, framed, and physically attacked while the case takes a strange turn. Everyone seems to have a vested interest in the case - everyone except the suspect, who strangely seems determined to die.Episode Two: The Color of AmberWhen a woman sees a young girl being snatched by a man in a car, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) fears they may only have hours to get her back alive. Since only one percent of the victims in abduction cases survive beyond a day, new ACC James Morrison (Christopher Colquhoun) reacts by calling an Amber alert, which floods the media with public pleas for information. He also pulls Tony in to help with profiling likely abductors.Episode Three: NoceboAlex investigates the murder of a teenage girl and a young boy, who bear signs of ritual killings. The trail leads to a property tycoon who'll stop at nothing to get the rent, a preacher whose healing activities involve animal sacrifice, and a self-styled artist whose works not only depict violence, but are painted in blood. Tony puzzles over what the killer might want to gain and why. Is this religion? And is it one killer or two, with one suspect the acolyte of another?Episode Four: The Names of AngelsTwo women are found raped and strangled, wearing the clothing of victims killed years earlier in Europe. Is the killer boasting to police about past crimes, leaving bodies where they can easily be found? And why is he choosing victims from the business world? As Tony tries to unravel the deadly puzzle, he's confronted by an unpleasant distraction - an 18-year-old released killer turns up on his doorstep.Episode Five: Anything You Can DoWhen a vulnerable elderly woman is suffocated in her home, Alex and Tony suspect Bernard Kelly (Ian Peck), a security guard who has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and was seen at the scene of the crime by several witnesses. But when the killings escalate, it appears to be the work of more than one murderer. Could the deaths be connected to the sudden return of Tony's old hero, respected psychologist Jonathan Goode?. . .",

    "title":"I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!",
    "text":"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",

This show wasn't even expected to be picked up for a second season on The N, but the viewer response was so positive they brought it back. The shows should be watched in order to track character development. The main story line involves a teen-aged girl wrestling with her attraction to girls. Unlike most other shows touching upon this issue the character comes to terms with her lesbianism, which is key to the series. Seeing a show like this 25 years ago would have gone far in answering a lot of questions I was having. I'm glad to see positive queer role models are making it more often to the media.",

    "text":"I started watching this show on a whim, since I had nothing better to do.  I was hooked from the first episode, even though I'm not entirely sure why.  I liked how the characters interacted.  I moved to a different community when I was fairly young, but it was the opposite way.  I was going from a big city to a small, farming community.  So, I could relate to trying to fit in with the new community.Even if things are sometimes overdone, this series touches on points that few TV shows have.  There's been a few about racism, bigotry, fitting in, considering the future, etc, but this was the first time I watched a show, that was made for people under 18, about homosexuality.  This is why I find it to be a progressive show, since young people need to understand that there are people like this.  They don't have to exactly agree with everything, but I like how the show shows them as normal teenagers, which is how it is in reality.  Of course, I think some parents need to see this show for the same reason.I am hoping for a DVD release, and the Unbox is still missing 3 episodes from the 3rd season, namely \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Career Day\", and \"Spencer's 18th Birthday\".  Hopefully, these episodes will be posted at some point, too.  I'm only getting these in the Unbox form to show my support for this series, even though it's been out for a while.",

You don't have to be a kid to like it (even Though it's rated TV-Y7-FV).For those of you who don't know what the show is about, let me tell you. This show takes place in a fictional city called Amity Park. 14-year-old Danny Fenton and his friends, goth-girl Samantha \"Sam\" Manson, and techno-geek Tucker Foley, attend Casper High. Danny's parents are too obsessed with ghosts that they don't really think about anything else. One day there was an accident in his parents lab and he got ghost powers. He now protects the city of Amity Park from all kinds of ghosts, while avoiding ghost hunters like the \"Guys in White\" and his parents. Trying to keep his ghost half a secret while avoiding Mr. Lancer's wrath (his teacher) Sam and Tucker always have Danny's back when he needs them.I hope this review was helpful. It's one of my top favorite cartoons. I give it two thumbs up!",

His set didn't cover politics or any &#34;hot topics&#34; of the day, it covered generic topics ranging from Pop Tart instructions to eye exams.  Anyway, it was fun and I would recommend that episode to anyone looking for a good clean laugh without having to carry the weight of politics or depravity.  It was fun.",

I would recommend this collection to anyone. Adult humor, which is pretty much the norm with Stand Up. This was free with Amazon Prime..so the price is definitely right.",

Sure, there will be some comedians that you like more or less than others, but all of them will bring a smile to your face.I appreciate that Comedy Central does keep the language controlled, especially since so many comedians seem to drop those bombs so frequently. The &#34;bleeps&#34; are annoying, but I would rather hear them than the swearing.  I do wish they would keep out some of the indecent topics and references.  I am not expecting wholesome, child-friendly comedy, but I think we should be able to expect to not be uncomfortable hearing it with friends in the room.Overall, I find these quick little stand up sessions to be great entertainment while hanging out with friends or even waiting at the airport.

    "text":"Unlike the previous manufactured on demand (MOD) using DVD-Rs releases that had been available on Amazon, this is an official release by Shout! Factory. The picture and sound on this 4 disc release is great and each disc has 5 episodes on it. Also unlike the MOD release, this release has nicer main menus on the discs (the theme song plays while it loops through character images) and each episode has chapters (meaning when you click the next button it doesn't skip the entire episode). Like the MOD release this release has no extras, but that won't stop me from buying the seasons 2 and 3 releases though (I love this show and I personally don't care that much if it has no extras\/bonus features - extras\/bonus features are just that to me, an extra\/a bonus, especially when its only $20 -  but again that's me, I know others look at extras\/bonus features when making a decision to buy a DVD). The only \"flaws\" I found with this release is that on the inside of the case it lists what episodes are on each disc, but it does not list them in the order they actually play on each disc (except disc 2, that one is listed in the same order it actually plays on the disc), and the cover image is from season 2, not 1. Neither of these \"flaws\" affect the great quality of the show or the DVDs of course, I just wanted to mention them for those who may care and to give a detailed product review. This set does contain and play all 20 episodes of the first season in the correct order (except #2 and #3 are swapped, but it doesn't affect the story or anything). Below is the order the episodes play:1.  Mystery Meat2.  One of a Kind (supposed to be episode 3)3.  Parental Bonding (supposed to be episode 2)4.  Attack of the Killer Garage Sale5.  Splitting Images6.  What You Want7.  Bitter Reunions8.  Prisoners of Love9.  My Brother's Keeper10.  Shades of Gray11.  Fanning the Flames12.  Teacher of the Year13.  \"13\"14.  Public Enemies15.  Fright Night16.  Maternal Instinct17.  Lucky in Love18.  Life Lessons19.  The Million Dollar Ghost20.  Control FreaksI hope that helps anyone thinking of buying this great DVD release of this wonderful show!!!",

    "text":"Danny Phantom is one of the best Nick tv shows I have ever seen. I am one of theworlds greatest fans of the series. The story of a forteen year old average simple minded teenage boy with two friends that keeps on being mocked and bullied buy theself appointed \"cool group\" of the other schollars his own age who suddenly gotghost powers by accident because his friends pushed him into going into the ghost portal that didn't function correctly when he accidently whithout noticing pressed the button inside it is brilliant! When you see the ghost that came to life inside him and created the his ghost self it is actually quite clear that he isn't just half-half, but two in one. He became two and existed in two forms. His plain ordinary live human self and his live lifeless ghost self with all the powers. There are several episodes as proof of this. The first is the \"Splitting Images\"episode when Danny was mistaken for being the bully by Poindexter when he took overDanny's body and drove Danny Phantom through the mirror into his world. When Poindexter got thrown back through the mirror with Danny's body into his own worldDanny tells him \"Now I want my body and my life back!\". The second time is in thecomedy episode of \"Identity Crisis\". When Danny tried to get rid of his ghost self.By using his dad's ghost catcher he seperated his ghost self from his human selfand they both got mad and acted like clowns. Another one is \"The Ultimate Enemy\" When Danny again seperated his ghost self from his human self aswell as Vlad. When Danny did this his ghost self lost all controll over himself and became furious and combined with Vlad's ghost self and since Vlad is evil and seriously wanted to murder Jack aswell as Danny, Danny killed his human self. The main reason why I amso mad about this show is because of all the things his ghost self does. All thesuperhero stuff he does and adventures he has in his ghost form and all the natural obstacles he has to deal with everyday as his normal human self. Also ifyou think about it it is quite true that his normal human self will grow up, get older and some time, somewhere his last hour will come and he will pass away but hisghost self, (who actually is also Danny Fenton but is just given a more ghostly likenickname by his human self and also to hide his true identity), will always be there looking and sounding exactly the same as his 14 year old human self becauseghosts never ages because they are lifeless. He'll even be able to attend his ownfuneral. And during the years of his adult life he'll always look like his 14 year old self whenever he goes ghost. He'll always be there for centuries to come along with all the other ghosts of deceased people like Johnny 13, Kitty, Desiree, Ember Mclain, possibly Walker and Technus, the Box Ghost etc. These are just some of the reasons why I love this show so much and why I am such a big fan of it.",

    "text":"Of course, the biggest problem are the missing episodes. It's NOT the complete first season, but seeing as a lot of people already complained about that, I won't discuss that in detail. It just makes you feel like you've been cheated. After all the text on the DVD itself lies to you and it isn't really cheap, either.Before those DVDs were \"released\" I had bought all episodes in digital form and created my own box-sets. And I have to say, I actually still prefer those. The \"design\" of this DVD is just loveless, everything seems simply slapped on. Every fan could make a hundred times more appealing one.The quality of the DVDs is decent, but strangely enough they don't work on my player. I have a RC2-Player, so it sort of figures, but it never had problems with any RC1-DVD. It actually opens the DVD and shows the menu (again, totally loveless, doesn't even have any kind of BG-music), but it won't play the episodes. Huh. Comes with the DVD-on-demand, I guess.But I knew about all those points (except for the DVD-player problem), so why did I still buy it? Because I'm a *Phan*, that's why. I don't know if Danny Phantom will ever get a real DVD-set, so I am glad for every chance I have to get an \"official\" DVD.\/EDIT: FORGET WHAT I SAID.They changed the set so it now includes ALL EPISODES as advertised!!! THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH.",
