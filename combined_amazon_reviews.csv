I live to breathe another day in anticipation of Trey Parker's next installment, whether it be South Park or some other venture. South Park is truly the work of a genius. Thank you, Sir Parker. (In Britian they often ""knight"" certian individuals (usually after they are ""old"" or ""dead"") for their contributions to their society) :)Sometimes it is dry. Sometimes it is wet. And sometimes it is too moist for humor. But somebody has to do it!I would like to see new South Park episodes until the day I leave this mortal existence. However, I know that Sir Parker would want to ""move on"". However, I would much like to see South Park from the eyes of a 90 year old Trey Parker.

All three are worth a watch, this one is best. The average price of this box set, here on Amazon,  makes it an affordable laugh.While it is possible to start watching with any season of this show, I almost always recommend starting with season one; not too much sequential  story line.This is parody/satirical humor.

5.0,drawn together nicely,"Apparently I'm one of the few who really thinks Drawn Together is a fantastic animated show.  The animation is really good overall, second only to the Simpsons.  Very bright, colorful animation that makes everything look very nice.  A wide variety of creative characters each with their own special personality and goofy problems.  Solid storytelling that makes the characters more interesting, and a very wild adult sense of humor that has *so* much creativity you can barely keep up with the constant jumping around.  Imagine a more violent Simpsons or Futurama with the pacing in hyper mode.  That's basically what Drawn Together is all about.",[],B000GIOPK2,B000GIOPK2,A2582KMXLK2P06,1205866800000,0,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-03-18 19:00:00

5.0,"Funny, vulgar and sick: three of my favorite things...","People who like cartoons must be thankful for DVDs, because that technology opened up the floodgates for fans for every kind of animation. Whether you like classic Looney Tunes, hippy-dippy sci-fi parables or Asian tentacle porn, it's all there for you to find and enjoy. It's only been in the last 20 years or so, however, that American TV networks have clued into the idea that many adults like cartoons that have content specifically aimed at adults, even though some cartoons did well in prime-time even fifty years ago or so. Now, with DVD, you can not only watch entire seasons at a shot, you can also see the shows in their unadulterated glory.Which brings us to the Comedy Central series Drawn Together. I've been a fan of this show for a while, partly because of the writing and partly because of the cheerful way in which it steamrolls political correctness and good taste. If South Park is the Mount Everest of crude, crass animation, then Drawn Together is K2; it doesn't stand as tall, but it's a tougher climb. The truth of this was brought home upon watching the second season of the show on DVD. Much to my surprise, watching the DVD turned out to be a different experience than watching it in first run.Part of this is due to one of the DVD set's selling points: it's unexpurgated. I didn't think this would make much of a difference, as it's generally pretty clear what's been cut. As it turns out, there was a lot cut out of the show, and not just language: genitalia, violence, enough racist abuse to make the KKK turn red under their sheets, sex in a vast array of configurations and a whole lot of other content that probably produces instant pucker in the unfortunate souls who work in Comedy Central's Standards and Practices department. Now, I'm not one for censorship, but the additional material works against the show to a certain degree. What's there is still funny in multiple senses, from satire to slapstick, but actually being able to hit the money words (and shots) dilutes the humor a bit.As far as taste goes, DT is not a show to start novices on. If adult animation is still a new concept for you, and you think The Simpsons is bleeding-edge in the sometimes fluid space between being socially acceptable and being a pariah, then DT may cause seizures. For people who like edgy animation, this will be just the ticket. The voiceover artists and writers take their material seriously, and they're willing to go wherever the jokes take them (the season finale has a running gag with historical dates and the episodes connected to them that manages to be both subtle and sick).In terms of presentation, the DT set is relatively bare-bones. The whole season of 15 episodes is crammed onto two discs, leaving just enough room for a handful of interviews with the voiceover artists (minus Adam Carolla, who has plenty to do outside the show) and a karaoke singalong. The visual quality is pretty sharp, and the sound quality is good, but this isn't the kind of material you use to do any THX certifications with, so it's not like you'd expect much. Still, it's the episodes that matter, and for you sick little monkeys out there who like this kind of thing, Drawn Together season 2 is a worthwhile expenditure. Just don't leave it out where Grandma or the kids might get a hold of it. Either you'll scar them for life (maybe shuffling Granny into an early grave), or you'll never get it back.",[],B000GIOPK2,B000GIOPK2,AD5MZA8SOVMPJ,1218222000000,5,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-08-08 19:00:00

3.0,"Funny in the beginning, but wears thin","The second season of Comedy Central's animated, reality TV spoofing Drawn Together gets off to a great start, but sadly, it wears thin the further it goes on.  The season begins where the first one left off, with the house mates crash landing and eventually getting back to the house for plenty of animated insanity.  The visual gags are still quite funny, but the show's constant bombardment of homophobic jokes (especially with Captain Hero, which gets real boring and tired) and toilet humor without any kind of substance goes from hysterical to boring and contrived.  Granted we see the same kind of treatment on South Park, but with that show there's always an underlining hint of social commentary at the very least.  You won't find much of that here with Drawn Together, but then again, the show never really attempts to do such a thing either.  All that being said, there's still plenty to admire with the second season of Drawn Together, but it's nowhere near as funny as the first season was either.

5.0,DT at its finest,"What more can one say about Drawn Together?! The show is self-explanatory! And season 2 is just the perfect embodiement of this.

For the rest... Anything's game (which means laughing material) for this show. They'll stop at nothing on the road to destroying all taboos! And that's how this satiric animated show found itself a place in a rather crowded category (by quality even more than by quantity), where The Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy reign. But DT pushes the limit even further, nesting in that dirty area where even the other three won't go.The only limit to that strategy is that DT is burning the candle by the two ends, and hadn't the show been cancelled at the end of the third season, they'd probably have run out of taboos to break, anyway, after 4 to 5 years.But let's salute the effort and appreciate the freedom of speech of the show, even if half of this liberty's wasted on filthy, disgusting, low-level jokes.

4.0,A Good Set For The Casual Learner,"This set is great for the casual learner.  The set is getting dated - going back to the mid-90's, but not much has changed dramatically in the field of Biblical Archeology - which is largely the premise.  The narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons is pretty good, though cal lull you to sleep with the dulet tones.  The content is good as well, with interview of scholars, archaeologists, religious, and others who interweave the various components together to explore some of the Bible's unanswered and unanswerable questions. The integration of Jewish and Christian thought is well done, and I believe that either Christian or Jew will find this set entertaining and enlightening.  If you are a heavy duty Bible scholar, this is pretty light weight.  For the bulk of us, though, you will learn a lot, it will pique your interest, and you can feel comfortable that there isn't a great religious agenda behind the shows.",[],B000GIPKWY,B000GIPKWY,A38AAPXSJN4C5G,1310238000000,3,False,Video & Entertainment,2011-07-09 19:00:00
5.0,Mesmerizing and Addicting,"I own the boxed set of this collection. Even though I was an avid fan of the show, I still re-watch the DVD episodes with rapt attention.  Unlike many religious themed films, this series does not promote a specific point of view. Viewers of all faiths and denominations will find that it deepens and enriches their understanding and appreciation for the spiritual lessons of the Bible. Each episode is well-rounded, beautifully photographed and a complete delight to watch.The Mysteries of the Bible series weaves questions about the Biblical figures, culture and spiritual meaning into a visual and intellectual feast. It combines actual footage of locations in the Bible with amazing religious art, captivating narration and answers from archeology and a spectrum of Biblical scholars. It's a formula that mesmerized fans for years. Who would have thought that a show like this would so captivate the non-scholars among us?This series succeeded for so long because it recognized that readers of the world's most popular book want to know and understand more about the culture, context and deeper meanings of the Bible. You won't regret purchasing any of the episodes or DVD's.

5.0,It's a Great Reference and Review,"This is the seven disc series offered by A&E; and still does not cover all the episodes put out by this series. I guess the remaining ones are on volume 2? Okay, so the 22 episodes offered here are all interesting and informative. What I liked best about the series is that they are going on the premise that everything in the Bible is to be looked at as fact. However, the series does offer the opinions of scholars that sometimes suggest otherwise and they pose some interesting facts and questions that do not always line up with archeological finds. When asked for their opinions, scholars will offer beliefs that do not always line up with most dogmatic ways of thinking, In other words, I understood this series to be unbiased and presented the facts fairly and allowed different opinions to be heard. Many of them which surprisingly do support many held beliefs we have all been taught.When I first bought this series a few years ago, I watched it but really couldn't appreciate it. Now that I am actively involved in religious education, I see this series in a whole different light. It has the basic information for beginners, but also has many surprising facts that I still didn't know after many years of hard religious studies. I certainly recommend this set as a supplement to anyone's religious pursuits and it makes a great starting point for discussions as well. Well put together and well presented.

I do not follow a priest or a preacher or churches or a religion as others do; -no disrespect intended here. Rather I prefer being a Catholic because of its universality.  Meaning to say, where ever in the world I go, all the sacraments and sacramental celebrations are the same. This is not to include such things as the inquisitions and church abuses.

5.0,South Of Nowhere Season 1,"I was very pleased with my recent purchase of season one of south of nowhere on DVD. I had read some bad things about this set but I bought it anyway, I was a big fan of the show back then and I just wanted to be able to watch it again. I wanted to buy all 3 seasons but that would have been pretty expensive. lol I do plan to buy the other two later. But as some have already stated, the theme music is different. I didn't like it at first but after you watch it all the way through you don't mind the theme music, it's just strange to me that they changed it...? this is a great gift for anyone you may know struggling with their sexuality. it got me through some tough times with my own when it was on television and now I can sit back and watch Spencer's plight knowing what she's gone through already firsthand. The set is only 3 DVDs long it's a very short season, that's why it's so cheap compared to season 2 & 3 but I recommend it to anyone. I really wish everyone would watch the whole season I think it would change some views of a lot of closed-minded people. All three seasons of the show depict a young girl struggling to balance between making her mother, a religious woman with strong opinions, happy and letting herself be who she is finding out she is. Her father, a guidance counselor of sorts, just wants her to be happy but he's got his own problems. The story also centers on her two brothers, one adopted and looking for his birth mother, and one blood brother who is trying to be a basketball star and runs into complications along the way. Ashley and Spencer are adorable together and this is, above all, a love story for the next generation. The set itself is no fuss no muss, comes with just the box and 3 DVDs, conservatively decorated, but it's what is inside that counts, which is hours of enjoyment that will make you go ""awww!"" and have you smiling to yourself. I would give this whole series as a gift to anyone and everyone if it weren't so expensive I think everyone should watch it it's both entertaining and helpful in understanding the plight of lesbian and bisexual people. Ashley never says she's a lesbian (that I remember. at least not in this season) and sometimes she plays around with aiden but in the end we know she's not into men. Spencer is ""not into labels"" and I love her for that so we never know whether to classify either of them as ""bi"" or ""gay"" as spencer called it, but I can pretty safely say  this is a show about girls, for girls, of any orientation.

If you're really a fan, you will consider this to be a low-quality, defective release, and you may consider it inferior to off-air copies.The theme music has been completely replaced with a different song.  This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs.  The original song is, of course, much more appropriate and better.There may be other unidentified cuts and alterations, as the series used a lot of rather expensive music.The versions on Amazon Unbox and iTunes have the same cuts.The DVDs have several mastering errors; the ""choose episode"" option simply doesn't work.",[],B000GK6NFK,B000GK6NFK,ASLA77MR9QKGP,1225306800000,41,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-10-29 19:00:00

3.0,"Five Stars For Woody, Three For Download","I downloaded this with a gift certificate from the Creative Zen purchase.  I've seen pieces of Woody Mann's DVD on Blind Blake, and as an instructor, he appears to know how to communicate with someone who is trying to learn.  In other words, his demonstrations are slow (but still in rhythmic time), and his explanations are meticulous and succinct.However, Amazon's Unbox download is lacking a pdf tablature to supliment the video download.  This could be detramental to people who want to learn the styles Mann teaches (Lonnie Johnson, Memphis Minnie, etc...) but do not have the musical vocabulary, or have not yet been introduced to it.My suggestion to the buyer is if you get stuck, find some mp3s & online tabs of these artists works, learn their phrases and then come back to this video for Woody Mann to help explain the thinking / theory behind these individual styles.  Because I know if I had not already learned one or two songs from these artists, along with some basic fretboard theory, I wouldn't know where to begin with this $14 purchase.Or just don't buy this video.  Spend the few extra bucks on the physical dvd and booklet.  Whatever works for you.(Note to Amazon:  The three stars is based on Amazon's poor judgement to not include pdf tabs.  This idea of downloading instructional videos is fantastic, but can easily be undermined by poor execution on the provider's part.)",[],B000GPHCXW,B000GPHCXW,A13B92MEBO2RZA,1164135600000,3,False,Video & Entertainment,2006-11-21 19:00:00

Now they have added those episodes back in (and increased the price) so my major objection is over.On the merit of the series itself, this is quite a steal.  This has to be one of the all-time best Anime series, especially for those who like a darker, edgier anime.  This is pure young character drama here, at its best.  There are mecha in this series (well, one), but it plays an extremely minor role and mecha fans should not get this series on that alone (get it because it's awesome!).  I really can't recommend this story enough.If Amazon would let me change my star rating, I would. (originally rated at 1-star for missing episodes).

I feel that a sidewalk could be a do-it-yourself type of job, IF you have the motivation. but if you plan on pouring a 16 x 22' drive way (especially in the summer) you MUST have someone helping you who knows about concrete. the air temperature, humidity, slump and wind all have a strong bearing on how the concrete will dry. Ready mix yards may suggest a retarder for adverse drying conditions but you really do need to know what you are doing. The timing of when to start finishing the concrete is never the same twice, so maybe the 10 min. limit he suggested is ok or maybe not. If you fresno the surface before it's ready and the bleed water can come up you will seal it and this can result in blistering, peeling and dusting of the surface which will greatly reduce the life of your concrete. I would suggest reading the ACI (ASCC1).

5.0,Finely Crafted Crime Drama,"This is not a review for season five only but also for all four previous seasons as well as season six currently being shown on British television.The show tells the story of a crime detective unit based in a fictional city in northern England. Together with the help of a brilliant but dysfunctional clinical psychologist (played to perfection by Robson Green), they try to solve the most grisly and disturbing murder cases.Each episode lasts 90 minutes so this gives more room for character and story development. It's also more brutal, intense and violent than most television shows so not for the squeamish.This is state of the art finely crafted crime drama featuring strong scripts and three dimensional characters you really care for. The acting by all involved is truly superb and the writing is top notch. It's riveting, captivating, engrossing, gripping and powerful stuff with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the last minute. This will have you glued on your sofa and make you shiver.

5.0,Robson Green FAN-atic,"Robson embellishes any movie he is in, regardless of the quality of the rest of it. I love having him to myself in TOUCHING EVIL, and WIRE IN THE BLOOD series. As another reviewer stated, he has perfected the role, ([bleeding heart psychiatrist]), who seems less afraid, but rather enchanted, with the illnesses of his patients. He empathizes with how they got the way they are instead of despising them for how they evolved from their molding circumstances. Without condescention, he faces the bad (the killer), and the good (the police and innocent victims), without judging either. That could make him appear apathetic, or stoic, but doesn't because of the way he has a grip on the role he plays (compassionate!). I have all of the captioned above and hope the rumors aren't true that this is the last of WIRE....But if it is, I'll be looking forward to whatever he does next!",[],B000H00VBQ,B000H00VBQ,A3D1LQCUWN12LD,1258657200000,2,False,Video & Entertainment,2009-11-19 19:00:00

5.0,Robson green and great writing,"This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.

5.0,"The best season yet, with one small exception","I've been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one, but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time, and less ""demented"" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written, produced, and directed in an entirely different style, e.g., the first one is fast-paced, with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds, while the second one is very grainy, jumpy, and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color, giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring, but it works extremely well.Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol, but Alex is at least as compelling, if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula, as the ""minor"" characters, are superbly well written and well acted.And then there's Tony, who is my ""small exception."" He's as charming and likeable as ever, if not more so, and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We don't really see just how much of a complete oddball he is. However, they more than made up for it in ""Prayer of the Bone"" so I can't really even call it a flaw.If you like a truly suspenseful, intelligent, multi-layered drama, but previous episodes have left you uncertain about watching this series, give season five a try.",[],B000H00VBQ,B000H00VBQ,A1CIZ90FFOZTLM,1219345200000,3,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-08-21 19:00:00

5.0,Hard to over-rate,"It's difficult to avoid superlatives, here. Production values, acting, narrative, all add to the series's early development and to the growth of the ensemble characters, particularly Hermione Norris's (then) DI Carol Jordan and of course Robson Green's portrayal of Tony Hill. As with all of the series, though, all of the core characters gain some detail. The cinematography deserves some notice, as well, particularly as this DP, Dominic Clemence, avoids the hand-held excesses that crop up and intrude with some later DPs. The visual element, combination of scenic with close work, contribute a great deal to the specific story, but also add to a continued sense of mood and atmosphere. The care in production and editing doesn't jump into the foreground, as it shouldn't, but gives the action an excellent context. Ironically, one of the producers has commented repeatedly that they long to replicate the work of American crime drama, but this series is an excellent example of what the US could produce, but doesn't.",[],B000H00VBQ,B000H00VBQ,AZT56GCNS5J9E,1368039600000,0,False,Video & Entertainment,2013-05-08 19:00:00

Cast was well chosen and act as though this is not a program but real crime drama. Not wooden but includes little pieces of their lives away from the crime scene. A must see program.

4.0,If Only We Could Make Out What They're Saying,"""Wire in the Blood, Season 5,"" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial, based on the works of Val McDermid, to reach these shores.  The series, a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill, criminal profiler, is produced by Green's production company for the British Granada TV: he's one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here, which has been spun off as a standalone.In addition to Green, the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries, and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding, Hill's foil, romantic and otherwise.  This season, as most, is simply advertised as ""based on characters created by"" McDermid, and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However, the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality, solid mysteries, with some of the well-known author's intensity; some of her edginess and grit, and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid, of course, is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home, you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent, lightened, a bit, by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot, which McDermid is, Scots-born.At any rate, the series is set in McDermid's fictional ""Bradfield,"" it is filmed in Manchester, the actual city in which she sets her work, after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchester's an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here, full of interesting looking architecture, with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately, the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect, and there are no subtitles, a puzzling oversight considering Green's standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.1. ""Colour of Amber.""  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street, in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery, dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.2. ""Nocebo.""  A sadistic, ritualistic killer seems to be at work, targeting children.  Another strong, intense episode, more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be, giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher, Dr.Kingston.3. ""Names of Angels."" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive, blond young businesswomen.  A clever, perhaps too clever, outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character, clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  ""Christopher"" has been a patient of Hill's while imprisoned for the crime, and, as he was so young when he committed it, he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.4. ""Anything You Can Do."" Yet another apparent serial killer at work, putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one, but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of ""Christopher,"" the released Liverpool child murderer.Green is, of course, a handsome man, and a good actor, and he gives us an intense, intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.

5.0,Only 4 of the 5 episodes included in this set,"Just so you know!!!Episode One: Prayer of the Bone, was considered a ""special"" and is not included in the Season 5 Set. It is scheduled to be released as a separate DVD on August 5th 2008. Each episode is about 83 minutes in length. This is a quality series that seems to improve each year as the character delvelopment matures.~ ~ SEASON 5 EPISODES ~ ~Episode One: Prayer of the BoneIn the season premiere, Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) finds himself a fish out of water when he's invited to Texas as an expert witness in a case where an Iraq combat veteran has confessed to brutally slaughtering his wife and two young children. His defense team claims that he's suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but the prosecution asks Tony, who met with the soldier in the UK, to join them in disproving that claim. Alone in a strange country, surrounded by hostile lawyers and police, Tony finds himself at the center of a death penalty case with competing legal and political interests. He's insulted, threatened, framed, and physically attacked while the case takes a strange turn. Everyone seems to have a vested interest in the case - everyone except the suspect, who strangely seems determined to die.Episode Two: The Color of AmberWhen a woman sees a young girl being snatched by a man in a car, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) fears they may only have hours to get her back alive. Since only one percent of the victims in abduction cases survive beyond a day, new ACC James Morrison (Christopher Colquhoun) reacts by calling an Amber alert, which floods the media with public pleas for information. He also pulls Tony in to help with profiling likely abductors.Episode Three: NoceboAlex investigates the murder of a teenage girl and a young boy, who bear signs of ritual killings. The trail leads to a property tycoon who'll stop at nothing to get the rent, a preacher whose healing activities involve animal sacrifice, and a self-styled artist whose works not only depict violence, but are painted in blood. Tony puzzles over what the killer might want to gain and why. Is this religion? And is it one killer or two, with one suspect the acolyte of another?Episode Four: The Names of AngelsTwo women are found raped and strangled, wearing the clothing of victims killed years earlier in Europe. Is the killer boasting to police about past crimes, leaving bodies where they can easily be found? And why is he choosing victims from the business world? As Tony tries to unravel the deadly puzzle, he's confronted by an unpleasant distraction - an 18-year-old released killer turns up on his doorstep.Episode Five: Anything You Can DoWhen a vulnerable elderly woman is suffocated in her home, Alex and Tony suspect Bernard Kelly (Ian Peck), a security guard who has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and was seen at the scene of the crime by several witnesses. But when the killings escalate, it appears to be the work of more than one murderer. Could the deaths be connected to the sudden return of Tony's old hero, respected psychologist Jonathan Goode?. . .",[],B000H00VBQ,B000H00VBQ,A1ON6MD535DQEI,1215716400000,13,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-07-10 19:00:00

5.0,I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!,"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",[],B000H00VBQ,B000H00VBQ,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1318273200000,12,False,Video & Entertainment,2011-10-10 19:00:00

This show wasn't even expected to be picked up for a second season on The N, but the viewer response was so positive they brought it back. The shows should be watched in order to track character development. The main story line involves a teen-aged girl wrestling with her attraction to girls. Unlike most other shows touching upon this issue the character comes to terms with her lesbianism, which is key to the series. Seeing a show like this 25 years ago would have gone far in answering a lot of questions I was having.

5.0,"Progressive Television, at last!","I started watching this show on a whim, since I had nothing better to do.  I was hooked from the first episode, even though I'm not entirely sure why.  I liked how the characters interacted.  I moved to a different community when I was fairly young, but it was the opposite way.  I was going from a big city to a small, farming community.  So, I could relate to trying to fit in with the new community.Even if things are sometimes overdone, this series touches on points that few TV shows have.  There's been a few about racism, bigotry, fitting in, considering the future, etc, but this was the first time I watched a show, that was made for people under 18, about homosexuality.  This is why I find it to be a progressive show, since young people need to understand that there are people like this.  They don't have to exactly agree with everything, but I like how the show shows them as normal teenagers, which is how it is in reality.  Of course, I think some parents need to see this show for the same reason.I am hoping for a DVD release, and the Unbox is still missing 3 episodes from the 3rd season, namely ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Career Day"", and ""Spencer's 18th Birthday"".  Hopefully, these episodes will be posted at some point, too.

It has good storylines, character development, and is has great plots.For those who think that Danny Phantom is for kids only, they're wrong. I am a teenager myself and I love the show. You don't have to be a kid to like it (even Though it's rated TV-Y7-FV).For those of you who don't know what the show is about, let me tell you. This show takes place in a fictional city called Amity Park. 14-year-old Danny Fenton and his friends, goth-girl Samantha ""Sam"" Manson, and techno-geek Tucker Foley, attend Casper High. Danny's parents are too obsessed with ghosts that they don't really think about anything else. One day there was an accident in his parents lab and he got ghost powers. He now protects the city of Amity Park from all kinds of ghosts, while avoiding ghost hunters like the ""Guys in White"" and his parents. Trying to keep his ghost half a secret while avoiding Mr. Lancer's wrath (his teacher) Sam and Tucker always have Danny's back when he needs them.I hope this review was helpful.

5.0,Great Show And Great DVD Release!,"Unlike the previous manufactured on demand (MOD) using DVD-Rs releases that had been available on Amazon, this is an official release by Shout! Factory. The picture and sound on this 4 disc release is great and each disc has 5 episodes on it. Also unlike the MOD release, this release has nicer main menus on the discs (the theme song plays while it loops through character images) and each episode has chapters (meaning when you click the next button it doesn't skip the entire episode). Like the MOD release this release has no extras, but that won't stop me from buying the seasons 2 and 3 releases though (I love this show and I personally don't care that much if it has no extras/bonus features - extras/bonus features are just that to me, an extra/a bonus, especially when its only $20 -  but again that's me, I know others look at extras/bonus features when making a decision to buy a DVD). The only ""flaws"" I found with this release is that on the inside of the case it lists what episodes are on each disc, but it does not list them in the order they actually play on each disc (except disc 2, that one is listed in the same order it actually plays on the disc), and the cover image is from season 2, not 1. Neither of these ""flaws"" affect the great quality of the show or the DVDs of course, I just wanted to mention them for those who may care and to give a detailed product review. This set does contain and play all 20 episodes of the first season in the correct order (except #2 and #3 are swapped, but it doesn't affect the story or anything). Below is the order the episodes play:1.  Mystery Meat2.  One of a Kind (supposed to be episode 3)3.  Parental Bonding (supposed to be episode 2)4.  Attack of the Killer Garage Sale5.

5.0,The Teen Ghostboy,"Danny Phantom is one of the best Nick tv shows I have ever seen. I am one of theworlds greatest fans of the series. The story of a forteen year old average simple minded teenage boy with two friends that keeps on being mocked and bullied buy theself appointed ""cool group"" of the other schollars his own age who suddenly gotghost powers by accident because his friends pushed him into going into the ghost portal that didn't function correctly when he accidently whithout noticing pressed the button inside it is brilliant! When you see the ghost that came to life inside him and created the his ghost self it is actually quite clear that he isn't just half-half, but two in one. He became two and existed in two forms. His plain ordinary live human self and his live lifeless ghost self with all the powers. There are several episodes as proof of this. The first is the ""Splitting Images""episode when Danny was mistaken for being the bully by Poindexter when he took overDanny's body and drove Danny Phantom through the mirror into his world. When Poindexter got thrown back through the mirror with Danny's body into his own worldDanny tells him ""Now I want my body and my life back!"". The second time is in thecomedy episode of ""Identity Crisis"". When Danny tried to get rid of his ghost self.By using his dad's ghost catcher he seperated his ghost self from his human selfand they both got mad and acted like clowns. Another one is ""The Ultimate Enemy"" When Danny again seperated his ghost self from his human self aswell as Vlad. When Danny did this his ghost self lost all controll over himself and became furious and combined with Vlad's ghost self and since Vlad is evil and seriously wanted to murder Jack aswell as Danny, Danny killed his human self. The main reason why I amso mad about this show is because of all the things his ghost self does. All thesuperhero stuff he does and adventures he has in his ghost form and all the natural obstacles he has to deal with everyday as his normal human self. Also ifyou think about it it is quite true that his normal human self will grow up, get older and some time, somewhere his last hour will come and he will pass away but hisghost self, (who actually is also Danny Fenton but is just given a more ghostly likenickname by his human self and also to hide his true identity), will always be there looking and sounding exactly the same as his 14 year old human self becauseghosts never ages because they are lifeless. He'll even be able to attend his ownfuneral. And during the years of his adult life he'll always look like his 14 year old self whenever he goes ghost. He'll always be there for centuries to come along with all the other ghosts of deceased people like Johnny 13, Kitty, Desiree, Ember Mclain, possibly Walker and Technus, the Box Ghost etc. These are just some of the reasons why I love this show so much and why I am such a big fan of it.",[],B000H0YRNY,B000H0YRNY,ACVPB7O29WMTH,1272567600000,2,False,Video & Entertainment,2010-04-29 19:00:00
5.0,At least something,"Of course, the biggest problem are the missing episodes. It's NOT the complete first season, but seeing as a lot of people already complained about that, I won't discuss that in detail. It just makes you feel like you've been cheated. After all the text on the DVD itself lies to you and it isn't really cheap, either.Before those DVDs were ""released"" I had bought all episodes in digital form and created my own box-sets. And I have to say, I actually still prefer those. The ""design"" of this DVD is just loveless, everything seems simply slapped on. Every fan could make a hundred times more appealing one.The quality of the DVDs is decent, but strangely enough they don't work on my player. I have a RC2-Player, so it sort of figures, but it never had problems with any RC1-DVD. It actually opens the DVD and shows the menu (again, totally loveless, doesn't even have any kind of BG-music), but it won't play the episodes. Huh. Comes with the DVD-on-demand, I guess.But I knew about all those points (except for the DVD-player problem), so why did I still buy it? Because I'm a *Phan*, that's why. I don't know if Danny Phantom will ever get a real DVD-set, so I am glad for every chance I have to get an ""official"" DVD./EDIT: FORGET WHAT I SAID.They changed the set so it now includes ALL EPISODES as advertised!!!

5.0,All 20 episodes from the first season in one DVD release... Awesome!,"In 2004, American animator and series creator Butch Hartman had created the animated series ""Danny Phantom"".  Aired on Nickelodeon in 2004-2007, the series was produced by Billionfold Studios.""Danny Phantom"" is a series that focused on the adventures of a teenager named Danny Fenton who has parents who are well-known ghost hunters.  His parents created a Ghost Portal which would bridge the real world with the Ghost Zone but when Danny tried to use it, the Ghost Portal didn't work.  But while inside the portal, he turned on the ""on"" button (which his parents forgot existed) and it activated the portal.Because he was inside of the portal, the portal fused with his DNA with ectoplasm and now he has been transformed into Danny Phantom.The only one that knows his secret is his best friends Sam (a goth vegetarian) and Tucker (who is a technophile and a meat-lover) but somehow Danny's parents have an inkling that one of their children may be a ghost but instead of think Danny is the ghost, they think it's his older sister Jasmine.But Danny now has these powers that allow him to be a ghost which allows him to fly, be invisible and eventually through the season, learns that he has other powers.  And now, Danny uses his powers for good against bad ghosts that are plaguing his hometown.While the series has been released on DVD before (albeit not including all episodes which frustrated ""Danny Phantom"" fans), the license for ""Danny Phantom"" has been acquired by Shout! Factory and fortunately, the first season of ""Danny Phantom"" will feature all 20 episodes on DVD.Episode listing on ""Danny Phantom: Season 1' DVD are as follows (note: these are spoilerless summaries):DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - Mystery Meat  - Danny uses his new ghost powers to take on the ghost Lunch Lady.EPISODE 2 - One of a Kind  - Skulker the ghost hunter has his target set on Danny Phantom.EPISODE 3 - Parental Bonding - Danny uses his ""overshadowing"" power to take control of his dad during a parent-teacher conference.  Meanwhile, a ghost amulet turns a girl that Danny likes into a dragon.EPISODE 4 - Attack of the Killer Garage Sale - Danny sells his parents ghost hunting junk, not knowing that the objects have residual ghost energy and now he must take on Technus, the Spectral Master.EPISODE 5 - Splitting Images - Danny uses his power to get back at Dash, the school bully but accidentally triggers the ghost of Poindexter, a kid who was bullied.DISC 2:EPISODE 6 - What You Want - Wish granter Desiree gives Tucker ghost powers.EPISODE 7 - Bitter Reunions - Danny meets his evil opposite, Vlad Plasmius.EPISODE 8 - Prisoners of Love - Danny fears that he may be breaking his parents up when he accidentally knocks his father's anniversary gift to the Ghost Zone.EPISODE 9 - My Brother's Keeper - Jazz mistakes her younger brother's ghost hunting as a form of depression and signs him up for therapy.EPISODE 10 - Shades of Gray - A ghost wrecks a popular co-ed's school life and now she becomes a ghost hunter.DISC 3:EPISODE 11 - Fanning the Flames - Danny and Sam become romantic thanks to the musical powers of ghost rocker, Ember.EPISODE 12 - Teacher of the Year  - Lancer and Danny's parents put pressure on him to ace a test.

For those familiar with this animated series, ""Danny Phantom"" uses strong lines around the characters and bold colors.  In fact, the series is quite vibrant and colorful and looks great on DVD.Dialogue, special effects and music are quite clear coming through the center and front channels.  I chose to watch the series via stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part, picture and audio quality for this series on DVD is very good.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Danny Phantom: Season 1' comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:In our household, Butch Hartman animated series reigns supreme.  Every morning, my young son must have his dose of ""The Fair Odd Parents"" or ""T.U.F.F. Puppy"" and before these two series, he was all about ""Danny Phantom"".If anything, it was an introduction for him as a young child to watch a series that brings a ghost hunter taking on bad ghosts in a hilarious and fun way.And many times I have watched this series with him and what I liked about it is that it was a series crafted not just for the kids but also for teens or adults.  These were continuous storylines that feature a young teenager with his powers and also dealing with high school bullies, being unpopular but enjoying life by hanging out with friends but taking on bad ghosts.  So, in a way, it has a similarity to popular superhero storylines such as Spider-Man and Superman (but in a more Dr. Strange meets Ghostbusters kind of way).  And also, he is a character that is not perfect and that many kids probably can relate to.Also, the artistic look of the series, especially with its character designs and its bold strokes will no doubt capture your attention and it's a visual style that continues today through Hartman's latest animated series.But the series has a lot of factors that make is so accessible and entertaining.  From Danny's family to his best friends but also the other characters that he meets through school or the ghosts that he encounters, there's always something new in each episode and not rehash of the same stories over and over again.As for the DVD release, yes, this has been released before but in the past, not all episodes were included.  With this latest DVD release from Shout Factory, you get all 20-episodes on four DVD's and one can only hope that Shout continues to bring the other two seasons (including the specials and possibly newer episodes) on DVD as well.Overall, if you were a big fan of ""Danny Phantom"" or young at heart and want an animated series with a ghost-busting storyline, definitely give ""Danny Phantom: Season 1' a try!",[],B000H0YRNY,B000H0YRNY,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,1335553200000,2,False,Video & Entertainment,2012-04-27 19:00:00

4.0,"Decent DVD, but lots of technical glitches","First of all, it is nice to see this show available on DVD, especially for those of us who don't want to watch it on a 2 inch screen on an ipod.  The bad news is, this is a 'print-on-demand' disc that has a lot of glitches in it.  As stated in the product description, it is recorded on DVD-R discs and is a manufacture on demand product.  Although it has a slick package design, complete with the Nickolodeon logo and a bar code, and full color imprinted discs, I still can't help but feel that this is little more than something I could have made by setting my DVD recorder to tape the show when it airs.  As a DVD-R disc, it has all the glitches one expects from ""homemade videos.""  As stated in the product description, it will not play in a DVD-rom or computer drive, but I expected it to playback in a regular DVD player.  Uh, no--my multi-disc player had difficulty reading the disc, as did my portable player, and it got hung up at certain points.  There was nothing more annoying that getting half way through an episode and finding that you wouldn't get to see the end because of the glitch.  incidentally, if you fast-forward the disc, it can bypass the glitch, but you will miss the dialogue.  There are some duplication bloopers as well--for example, after the commercial break, sometimes entire lines of dialogue and even entnire scenes get repeated.Another important aspect is that this is not the ""complete season 1"" as the package and advertising might lead you to believe--it is actually only the first half of the first season.  The episodes are: (1)Mystery Meat (2)One of a Kind (3)Parental Bonding (4) Attack of the Killer GArage Sale (mistakenly titled ""Attack of the Garage Sale"") (5) Splitting Images (6)What You Want (7) Bitter Reunions (8)Prisoners of Love (9)My Brother's Keeper (10) Shades of Gray (11)Fanning the Flames (12)Teacher of the Year and (13) ""13"".  The first 2 discs feature 5 episodes and the last one has only 3, which seemed to be a waste of a disc.  There are no extra features or even subtitles and captioning is non existent, so at the price of $30 plus, it is not qorth it.  The full series is available on I-Tunes so it is not as if there is no demand for it.  If you can't wait and don't want to watch it on an ipod, go ahead and purchase the disc; if you don't mind tiny graphics and a 1 inch screen, go to the Itunes store.",[],B000H0YRNY,B000H0YRNY,A2ILHTVGYUZHI0,1248894000000,2,False,Video & Entertainment,2009-07-29 19:00:00

The episode titles are listed on the inside of the dvd box and the dvd menu plays the theme song with scrolling art in a loop.

1.0,Mixed review,"As the title says, this set is a mixed review.The good, looks like they got the COMPLETE season out, not part like in the first release.The bad, the physical discs themselves are cheap DVD-Rs, not even real commercial quality DVDs.  This means they are very delicate and most likely will degrade in a year or two as the purple dye fades.  The authoring on them is slipshod, I couldn't even play the first disc on an older DVD player without the disc skipping and the picture being pixilated beyond anything watchable.  Ended up having to watch it on my PS3.I really, really wanted the series and when it's finally released, it looks like a cheap pirate job.

4.0,A Mixed Blessing,"Danny Phantom did the impossible for this cynical viewer; it made me love cartoons all over again. A wonderful lighthearted gem that told the story of a boy growing up while handling his ghost powers in a children's network managed to create depth, character development, and story arcs that increasingly gets better each episode (unfortunately to drop by the poorly conceived Season Three).Season One starts at the beginning, where we're introduced to the main cast and their eccentric personalities. Little by little, the majority of them grow into their defined roles: Danny slowly gains confidence as he balances hero life with his normal alter ego, his older sister Jazz realizes the truth behind her brother and supports his decision in secret while softly embracing her family's ghost life, Valerie turns from a spoiled, rich brat to a kick butt ghost hunter out for revenge (and later, justice), etc. But truly it is the character Vlad Masters who shines with his debonair, mysterious, and complicated persona--his opposites and similarities with Danny all clear--a myth arc that plays a key role on Danny's struggle with darkness. There's a lot of continuity despite half of the episodes remaining as filler, but since it's the first season, those are meant to establish the characters and elements we all learned to love over time.THE GOOD: ""Parental Bonding"" takes in numerous subplots and mixes them flawlessly. ""What You What"" is a roller coaster look into Tucker's inferior complex towards his newly supercharged best friend, delivered without hamming the emotions or loosing any. ""Bitter Reunions"" breaks the status quo and marks the beginning of the manipulatively awesome Vlad. ""Shades of Gray"" takes a pre-existing character and breathes new life into her as Valerie turns from pampered princess to hardened ghost hunter. ""Fanning the Flames"" established a solid story while making the Danny/Sam romance lovable (a farcry when Season Three makes it deplorable). ""Public Enemies"" raises the bar by having an antagonist succeed and Danny maturing to accept his duties. ""Maternal Instincts"" gives a topnotch performance between the mother/son relationship between Danny and Maddie and ""Control Freaks"" managed to prove Sam is more then just Danny's would-be love interest. But the best episode in Season One is the magnificent ""My Brother's Keeper"" which begins the excellent character development of Danny's older sister Jazz who starts off as a know-it-all constantly shielding Danny from the harsh realities of life. There, she begins to see the potential in her kid brother. It is, in my opinion, the most sentimental and heartwarming out of all the Danny Phantom episodes.THE EH, AVERAGE: ""Mystery Meat"" properly introduces the characters and backgrounds, but falters in the second half with less-then-believable subplots. ""One Of A Kind"" shows the first sign of DP's use of Major Plot A and minor subplot B. ""Attack of the Killer Garage Sale"" is fine, but clumsily tries to tie Danny's heroism and normalcy that others succeed better in. ""Prisoners of Love"" does a commendable job showcasing the radically different Ghost Zone, but is tackled with a dumb subplot involve stereotypical rednecks and a predictable romance. ""Teacher Of The Year"" is so morally focused that it feels less Action/Comedy, more Saturday Morning educational program. ""13"" is decent, but lacks oomph. ""Lucky in Love"" enhances the Love Arc and boosts some secondary characters, but is otherwise unremarkable and ""the Million Dollar Ghost"" has a confusing Xanatos Gambit from Vlad and a faulty father/son bonding between Danny and Jack.THE DOWNRIGHT BAD: ""Splitting Images"" which is all-around deplorable. Despite triggering Danny's Growing Darkness Arc, it's meshed with a antagonist who lost his purpose halfway through the series and a jarring concept of right vs. wrong between Danny and Sam. And lastly ""Fright Night"" which degrades Danny's current growth by making him unlikeable and jerky.The DVD only covers the first 13 episodes. There are no extras, but the episodes themselves are in good quality. And I will give Nickelodeon credit; they did put the episodes in their PROPER chronological order. All except ""Parental Bonding"" (episode two) and ""One of a Kind"" (episode 3) which got switched with each other. The DVD covers, both front and back are also prone to error. The first volume alone for example has Danny with his ""DP"" chest insignia; something he does not receive until Season Two (partly covered in the second DVD).Hardcore fans will feel ripped off while the casual (the type who considers DVD extras more luxury then mandatory) may enjoy it. Now that the DVD contains all 20 episodes in on boxed set, the once high price is slightly more reasonable, but be warned that it still does not contain any extras, let along subtitles.",[],B000H0YRNY,B000H0YRNY,A293B44ZW3VU9W,1224010800000,12,False,Video & Entertainment,2008-10-14 19:00:00

1.0,"NOT ""Complete"" as advertised","Fans have been clamoring for Danny Phantom DVDs for ages, and while it's very exciting to finally get some, this is more than a little disappointing.  The back cover claims ""It's a scary good time with the COMPLETE first season of Danny Phantom."" (emphasis mine.)

I don't want to giev the plot away at all, but look out for a few things that I thought were AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  The little kids fight between the kid Chen Sing is with and Lo Lieh's son.  Hwang Jang Lee has 2 fights with Chen Sing and this I thought was the second real highlight of the film to go along with the story.  Southern fist versus northern leg at it's best.  Add in Hwnag's 3 grand children(corey Yuen, Doris Lung, and Yuen Biao!), and you have yourself a great movie.  I have a couple movies from the Black Dragon and both are watchable but very dirty in print.

5.0,So Happy I Can Get My O'Grady Fix Again!,"I loved this show when it was on the air and of course, was very upset when it got taken off. I've been looking for it to come out on DVD everywhere, but no such luck. And then one day I discovered that I could purchase it through Amazon Instant Video for an extremely great price so I did. In watching it again I'm reminded of the fact that while this show is yes, yet another one about a town where weird things happen its take on what its characters refer to as ""The Weirdness"" is still as fresh and funny as the first time I saw the TV show.In fact, while the show follows a group of high school students and the adults around them who have to deal with an ever changing and unpredictable weird events that affect them the real star of this show is ""The Weirdness"" itself. This phenomena whose source is never really explained, although hilariously debated in the show's opening by some of its characters from time to time, may one day see one's innermost true thoughts popping up in the form of visible talking thought bubbles that show up when one is trying to lie (Episode Bubbleheads) to everyone slowly turning into cats during the high school's rendition of American Idol (Episode O'Grady Idol) and much, much more. This premise allows the show to remain fresh and unpredictable.I'm still not sure why it was ever canceled, but this one goes into my bin of TV shows that were simply great and original but canceled by shortsighted morons. (There I said it) If you want a laugh and can't get enough of shows like Eureka and Warehouse 13 then I think you'll love this one too. So go ahead and get down with The Weirdness and the whole O'Grady gang.",[],B000H244DK,B000H244DK,A1QPQFNR8CV62G,1326999600000,1,False,Video & Entertainment,2012-01-19 19:00:00

4.0,"These are the only topics these comedians can be ""creative"" about? Race-Black-White/Sex/Women/Religion? Thats about it?","Regarding Gabriel Iglesias...Funny stuff, good light hearted slapstick style comedy. Well done! everyone needs this from time to time.Post below is of Comedy Central overall:I have been watching a bunch of these during editing work. I have noticed a trend of watered down, politically correct on world issues, yes often always using race, sex and a weed smoking as a overwhelming headline topic on these comics.What happen to the jokes on contraversial issues, and world issues? Specially during war, and all the government stripping of rights in the US. Comedians need to use this medium to break the silence of such hard topics.Sure there are funny content here, but seriously, Its either about blacks, and white, and women and men and being stupid, and loving to smoke out. Really?!! Watch Season 13-14, which is what I am currently watching. You just get more of this.  The cover image is of that British comedian who actually DOES bring up such hard topics and lets people interact with such issues. Yet, I have not seen him in any of the line up.I actually can't imagine the comedians being the limiting factor. I think its Comedy Network that filters this content. I hope I am wrong. I will continue watching more and hope to see and hear deeper, and more deep as well as newly stylized material.I liked...Bill Burr,Anthony Jezelneck,Greer Barnes,I will list others, but these I most recently saw.Others I like areLouis CK,Russel Peters,Alonzo Bodden was pretty good,Tom Papa was great,Doug Stanhope,Lewis Black,Kevin Nealon rather funny,Sebastian Maniscalco was Great!,Russel Brand,All Brian Posein was doing talking about his weewee..Ya thats the picture we need in our heads(rather annoying skit),Mike Birbiglia had a great delivery and overall interesting,I'll add more later.",[],B000H26EMY,B000H26EMY,A2ILI1KXJ7R3J,1392922800000,0,False,Video & Entertainment,2014-02-20 19:00:00

5.0,~Top 10 sets EVER on Comedy Central Presents~,"I am not sure what other comedian got her or his start as a result of heckling another comedian, but Patrice O'neal has this dubious distinction that greatly benefited him much more than the other guy. Other guy, yeah you, Smart Alec, if you are reading this, your suggestion to have him try his hand at stand-up, didn't turn out so bad for him after all, huh?! Just think, your inability to ignore his words launched him into the rarefied air of one of the All-Time Best. Guess you can tell your friends, &#34;I was just playing.&#34; This set is the 2nd time I became aware of Patrice O'neal, the first being his appearances on Chappelle's Show. Performances like this were the main reason so many would tune in to check out comedians that were not heard of before on a wide scale, and this avenue definitely paid dividends to those whose 20-25 minute set did not bomb. Patrice O'neal clearly had the goods and you can find so many uploads on YouTube that will make you laugh and laugh really loud, but strip down the jokes and you will hear that he was quite pensive in his approach to his jokes. He statement of how America in its arrogance will call its sports champions 'world champions' without playing another country, extremely funny & priceless but so true. From Elephant in the Room, Mr. P & Unreleased, his works are grand and no matter how much and how often you listen to him, you'll paused and rewind to hear 'that' bit again and again. His performance here is no different. Dude died entirely too soon and it is hard to refer to him in the past tense. Such a great thing that we get to refer to him at all.",[],B000H26EMY,B000H26EMY,APRHZYE8U0IGM,1401562800000,0,False,Video & Entertainment,2014-05-31 19:00:00
